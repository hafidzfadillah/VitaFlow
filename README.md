## Problem

Before getting acquainted with our product, let's take a look at Agus's story. Agus is an employee at PT Astri, working 10-12 hours a day. He doesn't have time to manage his lifestyle and often chooses unhealthy food, neglecting his health. One day, he contracted tuberculosis and had to take a long leave of absence. After recovering, he wants to change and try to live a healthy lifestyle, but he encounters several problems:

- Agus lacks time to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to his busy schedule at the company.
- Agus struggles to choose healthy and nutritious food due to a lack of knowledge about his body's nutritional needs.
- Agus finds consulting with a nutritionist or personal trainer too expensive and impractical to access.
- Agus is confused about where to start if he wants to adopt a healthy lifestyle.

## Solution 

Based on Agus's problems, we have designed several solutions to help him maintain a healthy lifestyle more easily and effectively, including:

- Providing customizable features that can align with the user's schedule, such as personalized workout plans and reminders that assist Agus in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
- Offering a program of recommended healthy foods and a food journal feature with a calorie counter to monitor Agus's daily nutrient intake.
- Creating an AI feature that can serve as a consultation medium and personal companion for Agus during his program.
- Developing an application with a user-friendly UX and flow that Agus can easily understand, such as creating daily tasks. This way, Agus won't be confused about where to start.

## Product

To address these problems, the Orion Team has developed a mobile application called "Vitaflow". True to its name, Flow, we have created the Vitaflow app with a user-friendly UX and application flow.
